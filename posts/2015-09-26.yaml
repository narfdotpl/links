          100 ms lag is what we have now,

          "Focus effects are the crux of what makes tvOS communal. Focus
          effects provide visual feedback not only to whomever is
          quarterbacking the remote, but also to any onlookers who are
          following along. They’re what separate this native TV experience
          from AirPlay-ing your iPad to the big screen."

          "By making the view controller conform to the protocols for the
          `ValidatesUsername` and `ValidatesPassword` mixins, it
          automatically pulls the `isUsernameValid()` and `isPasswordValid()`
          methods into the code.  [...] This is a nice trick to keep your
          view controllers clean without having to use extra helper objects."
