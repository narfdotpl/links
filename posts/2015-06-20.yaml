          "Agile increases the feedback frequency while giving engineers no
          real power. That’s a losing bargain, because it means that they’re
          more likely to jerked around or punished when things take longer
          than they «seem» they should take. These decisions are invariably
          made by business people who will call shots based on emotion rather
          than deep insight into the technical challenges or the nature of
          the development."

          "If you’re set on a remote job (e.g. you don’t want to drag your
          family around) you really don’t want to be looking for companies
          you like and then trying to argue the case for remote working. Even
          if you end up working at that company if they aren’t set up for
          remote working you’ll have a fairly miserable experience. [...]

          ~50 companies [...] ~30 email conversations, ~20 Skype calls [...]
          ~10 in-person interviews in San Francisco [...] two confirmed
          offers with confirmed (decent) salaries"
