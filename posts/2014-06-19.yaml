          "[...] unmanned NASA and ESA programs have been putting landers on
          Titan, shooting chunks of metal into an inbound comet, driving
          rovers around Mars and continuing to gather a variety of priceless
          observations from the many active unmanned orbital telescopes and
          space probes sprinkled through the Solar System. At the same time,

          laptops, changing batteries, and speaking to the occasional
          elementary school over ham radio."
