          "Current optical tags, such as barcodes, must be read within a short
          range and the codes occupy valuable physical space on products. We
          present a new low-cost optical design so that the tags can be shrunk
          to 3mm visible diameter, and unmodified ordinary cameras several
          meters away can be set up to decode the identity plus the relative
          distance and angle."
