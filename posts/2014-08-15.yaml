          Interactive introductory video to "a JavaScript library that starts
          with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for
          artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this
          for today's web".

          The Visual Microphone: Passive Recovery of Sound from Video

          "When sound hits an object, it causes small vibrations of the
          object’s surface. We show how, using only high-speed video of the
          object, we can extract those minute vibrations and partially recover
          the sound that produced them, allowing us to turn everyday objects—a
          glass of water, a potted plant, a box of tissues, or a bag of
          chips—into visual microphones."

          "Typo is a programming language that runs in Haskell's type system. A
          Typo program is compiled to a Haskell module that's then typechecked
          to compute the result. All computation happens in Haskell's type
          system."

          "This is the first programming language to be publicly released from
          a plane flying over the Atlantic Ocean. I'm almost certain of that."

          "[Djent is] the onomatopoeia of a heavily palm muted distorted
          guitar chord which is usually played as but not limited to a 4
          string double octave powerchord, and as a result sounds much more
          metallic and sonically present than a 'chug', 'chugga' or 'djun'
          per se, and which is basically how Periphery would describe its
          palm muted guitar sound."
