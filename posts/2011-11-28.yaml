          "[...] a system, Neo.  That system is our enemy.  But when
          you're inside, you look around, what do you see?  Businessmen,
          teachers, lawyers, carpenters.  The very minds of the people
          we are trying to save.  But until we do, these people are
          still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy.
          You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to
          be unplugged.  And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly
          dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it."

          "I sometimes run a very old version of The Sims to optimize
          living conditions for two people with busy lives who want to
          achieve maximum happiness and self actualization. [...] Turns
          out that an errant chair or a table configuration might cause
          undue friction and, over time, decrease joy and happiness.
          [...] It's kind of my version of debugging life, and it's
          another reason why I have a PC lying around.  I don't play the
          game unless I'm trying to figure out a more optimal living
          condition.  I don't use this religiously by any means, but as
          more of thought experiment."
