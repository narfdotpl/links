          "I think of boredom as a clock. Every second that someone on my
          team is bored, a second passes on this clock. After some aggregated
          amount of seconds that varies for every person, they look at the
          time, throw up their arms, and quit."

          [...]

          A terrific way to accelerate the boredom clock is a promise of
          productive and creative time that is then taken away. [...] The
          only thing this decision teaches your team is how little you value
          the cultivation of your people."
