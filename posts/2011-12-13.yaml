          Good advice for youngsters, nothing new for adepts.  The bit
          about Janus is gold, though:

          > Don't use Janus.  It's a community maintained vim configuration
          > project that in theory sounds nice, but once you start using it
          > it's not all rainbows.  The current version of Janus installs
          > harmful plugins such as Syntastic and adds tons of opinionated
          > mappings and piles of hacks on top of one another.  The
          > "experimental" version of Janus is a rewrite that's meant to be
          > more configurable, but in fact it's just more fragmented and
          > harder to follow what's going on.  You should be in charge of
          > your `.vimrc` and always know what's going on, but with Janus
          > you're not.
