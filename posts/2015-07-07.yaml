          "If I estimate the number of iOS apps in the App Store, and get the
          difference between the estimate and the actual number, that
          difference will be larger than the number of successful apps.

          [...]

          If there’s a way out of despair, it’s in changing our expectations.

          Write the apps you want to write in your free time and out of love
          for the platform and for those specific apps. Take risks. Make
          those apps interesting and different. Don’t play it safe. If you’re
          not expecting money, you have nothing to lose."
