          "During the 100 days before the relationship starts, we observe
          a slow but steady increase in the number of timeline posts shared

          "When you test audio gear, you focus on it much more than usual.
          You pick great, varied, well-recorded music, you play it a bit
          louder than usual, and you pay attention to the details. You immerse
          yourself in the music, create an experience with it, and appreciate
          it. *That's* why new gear always sounds so good.

          You can do that anytime you'd like without spending a dime."
