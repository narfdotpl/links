          "My home screen is intentionally very simple. I do this to
          minimize distractions. The distractions are all tucked several
          screen swipes away. It is a simple reminder to me to keep things
          simple. The act of intentionally finding an app helps me become
          conscious to what I am doing and why."

          "At the end of every day, I open up my Day One journal and write
          down the highlights of what I accomplished that day. [...]

          By recognizing and rewarding these small wins each day, it builds
          up an intrinsic motivation that makes me want to keep doing the
          important work.

          Celebrating progress strengthens our emotional and motivated state.
          Which means we are happier and more motivated at work and are
          therefore more likely to be productive and creative. It keeps the
          cycle going."
