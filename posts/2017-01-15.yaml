          "Why on Earth are ports standardized but data storage isn’t?
          Why are data storage formats wildly variable, but file formats are
          readable across enemy lines? Why is it that I have to carry five
          dongles so my Macbook can play a PowerPoint presentation but a
          decades-old Rebel droid needs zero to stay interoperable with an
          enemy’s state-of-the-art battle station?"

          "I think the frustration I feel comes from an inherent desire to
          feel connected to people. I use my work as a way to connect to the
          world. On occasion people do manage to see what I am trying to
          express in my work and that is a very gratifying feeling. But often
          people find their own meaning in the work and it's been an ongoing
          process to accept that, especially when there is a consensus of
          which you are not a part."
