          "With this change, we can now have a file for each machine we
          intend to deploy on, named after the machine, put into the settings
          directory, and it'll be used automatically. Now, you've got the best
          of both worlds: site-specific configuration, managed by source
          control."

          "Programming is an exercise in overcoming how wrong you've been in
          the past. At first you'll overcome the syntax errors, then you'll
          overcome the structural errors, and then you'll come to align your
          code with the standards of a greater community and you'll feel safe
          and like you've made it. You haven't -- you're still wrong because
          you're *always* wrong. You are playing a game you cannot win. And
          let's face it -- if it was a game you *could* win you'd not be
          playing at all."
