          "It is possible to talk about something and have the words
          themselves not be very telling. Background knowledge matters
          a lot. I asked a 20 something about Bob Dylan a few days ago
          and he had never heard of him. He didn’t know much about the
          60’s. Neither does Watson. You can’t understand words if you
          don’t know their context."
