          "A lot of the camera movements and controls that video games have
          built up over the years will make many players want to throw up.
          [...] For that reason Land’s End is a hands-free experience. That
          means that navigation is done simply by looking at little white
          dots placed strategically through the environment, each
          representing possible paths or actions a player can undertake."

          "It might be interesting if Git had a new object that was below
          the Commit object — maybe a ExperimentalCommit that would get
          folded into a single Commit once it went through code review.
          That way, each developer could commit their scratchpad
          experimentations to mainline (so they can refer back to them in
          the future), but a separate commit history of code review could
          be generated and used as the «clean» history."
