          "Some people complain that 48 fps looks too much like a video
          game - which happens to be perfect for how we're using it. The
          in-video-game action sequences of VGHS Season 2 were shot at 48
          fps with the intention of playback at 48 fps. The in-the-real-world
          sequences are shot at a much more traditional 24 fps."
