          "The iPad has always had [...] a logical DPI of 132. [...]
          The iPhone and iPod touch have always had [...] a logical DPI
          of 163. [...] If the iPad's screen were scaled to 163 DPI,
          it would be 7.85" diagonally."

          "Luck is nothing to do with it. [...] If something breaks, it
          means somewhere there has been a mistake with a part or whatever
          it is, so it's not strong enough or has been designed wrong. [...]
          Normally it's human error.  It's the same as if I do a mistake in
          the car; it's not unlucky, it's my mistakes.  That's racing."
