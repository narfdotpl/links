          "[...] controlling the spread and impact of the disease requires

          "If you stack up the orange bars until 1/22, you get 444 cases.
          Now add up all the grey bars. They add up to ~12,000 cases.
          So when Wuhan thought it had 444 cases, it had 27 times more."

          "Rookie marketers make the mistake of thinking choice is a good
          thing. Choice is a tax on your time and attention. Consumers
          don’t want more choice, but more confidence in the choices
          presented. Customers want someone else to do the research and
          curate the options for them."
