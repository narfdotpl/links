          "Orca is an esoteric programming language designed to quickly
          create procedural sequencers [...].

          This application is not a synthesizer, but a flexible livecoding
          environment capable of sending MIDI, OSC & UDP to your audio/visual
          interfaces, like Ableton, Renoise, VCV Rack or SuperCollider."
