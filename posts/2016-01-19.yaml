          "Such model puts focus on iterative development, facilitating
          flexibility and growth. It’s quite different from premium games,
          where most energy is spent on the initial release, possibly
          followed by as few as possible patches.

          Running a game as a service influences priorities in some very
          practical terms."

          "[T]he Wu-Tang Clan sold its latest album, *Once Upon a Time in
          Shaolin*, through an online auction house. As one of the most
          innovative rap groups, the Wu-Tang Clan had used concepts for
          their recordings before, but the latest album would be their
          highest concept: it would exist as only one copy—as an LP, that
          physical, *authentic* format for music—encased in an artisanally
          crafted box. This album would have only one owner, and thus,
          perhaps, only one listener. By legal agreement, the owner would
          not be allowed to distribute it commercially until 88 years
          from now."
