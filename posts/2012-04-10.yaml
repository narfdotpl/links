          "In Requests, you'll be able to mount external services to the
          routing mechanism by mocking HTTP. To Requests, it'll be an HTTP
          Service, but in reality the service could be anything: a random
          number generator, ZeroMQ socket, proxy, WSGI application, &c."

          Minimal todo list iPhone app "almost entirely controlled
          by gestures".  I use it every day.  UI takes a few minutes to
          get used to, but after that it doesn't get in the way much...
          Learning which swipe means "check" and which means "delete"
          took me about three days, though.
