          "Instant Webcam encodes video in MPEG1 format and sends the
          frames over WebSockets to connected Browsers. The Browser then
          decodes the MPEG Stream in JavaScript and paints into a Canvas.
          It's a huge hack, but one that turned out to work really well."

          "Almost all integers are so large they're impossible to
          express within any finite universe. So &laquo;pick a random
          number&raquo; is quite dangerous."
