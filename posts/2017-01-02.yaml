          "Yaybahar is an electric-free, totally acoustic instrument
          designed by Gorkem Sen. The vibrations from the strings are
          transmitted via the coiled springs to the frame drums. These
          vibrations are turned into sound by the membranes which echo
          back and forth on the coiled springs."
