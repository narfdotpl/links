          "allows managing files with git, without checking the file
          contents into git"

          I started using annex to keep my mp3s in sync after buying the
          new laptop.  So far, I can only complain about the installation
          process (oh, the joys of Haskell).  I use only the very basic
          functionality, though.

          Most of my music collection is still not on the new machine.
          When I find that I miss some artist, I wake my old white MacBook
          from sleep, type something like "play john5" in my Air's terminal,
          and get actual mp3s from white:~/Music/mp3/john5 rsynced over
          wifi and opened in iTunes.  Quite pleasant. :)
