          I didn't read the entire article because it is too rambly and
          I don't share the author's affection for writing assembly, but
          a few fragments resonate well with me, for example this one:

          "At numerous times I found that conscious isolation can sometimes
          indeed lead to more direct insights, techniques and solutions to
          existing problems, which otherwise are not taken into account, if
          all of our activity is only based on and influenced by the prior
          research of others. Focus always has a cost and research takes time.
          That is especially true in today’s open source culture and the
          endless hourly influx of hip new projects via social media."

          interview with Peter Chung

          "I think people, in order to work, they have to focus on the
          process because the content doesn't inspire them. [...] Blinded
          by the process so that they, you know, are interested in at least
          something because, yeah, it's a hard reality when the thing that
          you're working on just isn't really good."

          "It's completely wrong to apply the same standards of critique
          to works that are made with different intents."

          "It also included several interesting phrases which stood out to
          me, including *Every Atom Procedural* and *Every Planet Unique*.
          On its own, this language was not a surprising angle for a game
          to take in its marketing. The Binding of Isaac’s Steam page, for
          example, promises ‘*you never play the same game twice*‘ but
          no-one so much as raises an eyebrow when they sit down and
          discover that they are, shockingly, playing The Binding Of Isaac
          every time."

          "When we use extreme language to talk about procedural generators
          (or any other kind of technology), we encourage people to draw
          extreme conclusions."

          "For many other generators, you might think that explaining how
          its processes work would be kind of… boring? You’d probably be
          right. A lot of generators are boring, and I think that’s one of
          the reasons why we reach for the big numbers and strong
          statements, to cover up this fact."

          "Drawing his finger across the screen, he nudged the lever bars
          to indicate attributes like body mass, aggressiveness, windpipe
          length, wetness, screechiness, harshness. (The software makes
          sounds based on roughly a hundred different parameters.) Then,
          while moving his thumbs across two graphical boxes on the
          iPad—one labelled “vowel map,” the other “pitch”—and
          simultaneously twisting the device in space, he generated a
          vocalization. The iPad’s physical movement determined the
          energy behind the utterance: the arc of the motion shaping the
          sound’s arc."

          "[Vision] is really a very inexact and artistic, personal
          interpretation of some form of reality."
