          "Why play Chess using pieces of just one color? Because it's
          weird, that's why!  [...] on-lookers understand enough
          about what's going on to know that something is very wrong.
          And that's exactly the point of Monochrome Chess - [...] to
          distort their sense of reality.

          The other half of the fun comes from the fact that Monochrome
          Chess requires unconventional thinking on the part of the players.
          To play Monochrome Chess, you need to unlearn many of the
          strategies and techniques you know from Normal Chess. To be good
          at Monochrome Chess, you need to learn to think in new ways."
