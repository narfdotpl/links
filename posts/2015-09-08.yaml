          "I don’t play games to have my skills tested. Many do, and that’s
          fair. I play games to have experiences, to feel smart and creative
          and badass, of course, but not to be tested by an imaginary
          examiner. When choosing a difficulty mode for a game, that’s far
          more about the time investment I want to make (do I not have time
          for a slow run, or do I want to make it last?) or how I want to
          feel (Wolfenstein had to go to easy, because when playing a game
          like Wolfenstein, I want to feel unstoppable). It’s not about
          difficulty, it’s about the style of play I want to extract from the
          game’s mechanics."

          "In homage, I've made a series of extended edits that hold a
          microscope up to these jewel-like sounds. Six Windows startup
          tones, from 95 to Vista, are slowed to 4000% of their original
          speed, transforming each into an ambient piece of several
          minutes' duration, and amplifying the internal structures of
          these iconic, dream-like sounds."
