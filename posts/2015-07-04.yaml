          "Do the bare minimum on stuff that's not advancing your career or
          teaching you something; if it has no career-adding value, people
          probably don't care enough about it for it to matter that you're
          putting in a minimum effort, as long as you don't get in anyone's
          way."

          "If your company won't let you work on something during normal work
          hours, then don't fucking do it on their behalf for any reason.
          Respect your time. Or no one else will."

          "This is also a classic example of a science fiction invented
          thing - in my case, magic - which, when taken all the way to its
          logical conclusion, quickly results in phenomena which are too
          complicated to be palatably explained to readers or used
          meaningfully in storytelling. I have the same problem with many
          other things, usually time travel. The writer has a duty to
          overthink things."
