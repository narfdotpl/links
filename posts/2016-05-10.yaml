          "Quite quickly the developer would arrive at a situation where the
          simplest course of action is to produce two implementations. One
          would be the genuine software desired by the tester and their tests.
          The other would be the software which the developer really wanted to
          build. Crucially, the switch in behaviour would be controlled by the
          environment. If there's a test running, the software would behave
          like *this*. If not, it would behave like *that*."

          "Bytebeat music has no conventional musical notation — there is no
          notes or chords or even instruments. All you have is a mathematical
          expression that is evaluated for each time frame to generate the
          next amplitude value of the sound wave."
