          "A typical problem is that, in the absence of equations, they
          project literal meanings onto words such as ‘grains’ of space-time
          or particles ‘popping’ in and out of existence. Science writers
          should be more careful to point out when we are using metaphors.
          My clients read way too much into pictures, measuring every angle,
          scrutinising every colour, counting every dash. Illustrators should
          be more careful to point out what is relevant information and what
          is artistic freedom."
