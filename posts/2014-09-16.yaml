          "SemVer tries to compress a huge amount of information — the nature
          of the change, the percentage of users that will be affected by the
          change, the severity of the change (Is it easy to fix my code? Or do
          I have to rewrite everything?) — into a single number. And
          unsurprisingly, it's impossible for that single number to contain
          enough meaningful information."
