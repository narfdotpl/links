          "On flat surfaces with no objects in their path, wheeled robots
          are more efficient than tracked, legged, and even aerial robots.
          In sand, mud, and rougher terrain, tracks are superior to wheels.
          However, with fixed objects, obstacles, and vertical surfaces in
          the path of a tracked robot with no alternative path, legged robots
          are superior. Even if moderate objects and obstacles can be overcome
          by tracks, continuous unstructured terrain over a large field of
          operation reduces the energy efficiency of tracked devices when
          compared to dynamic legged robots."
