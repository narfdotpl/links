          "A showcase of curated creative coding sketches".
          I'm blown away not only by the creations but also by the design

          "We wanted to explore ceramic designs that really required the
          use of 3D printing and would be nearly impossible to make any
          other way, even by hand. [...]  It took us over a month of
          experimentation to figure out how to properly print the material."

          The challenges involved in printing porcelain sound fascinating
          and intimidating!
