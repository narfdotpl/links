          > The spikes are mounted on the virus body (‘the nucleocapsid
          > protein’). But the thing is, our vaccine is only generating
          > the spikes itself, and we’re not mounting them on any kind

          > It turns out that, unmodified, freestanding Spike proteins
          > collapse into a different structure. If injected as a vaccine,
          > this would indeed cause our bodies to develop immunity.. but
          > only against the collapsed spike protein.
          >
          > And the real SARS-CoV-2 shows up with the spiky Spike.
          > The vaccine would not work very well in that case.

          > Proline substitution in just the right place would make the
          > SARS-CoV-1 and MERS S proteins take up their ‘pre-fusion’

          > This works because Proline is a very rigid amino acid. It acts
          > as a kind of splint, stabilising the protein in the state we
          > need to show to the immune system.

          "In some sense, being an independent artist means you work in
          sales. This is blindingly obvious to anyone who has been down
