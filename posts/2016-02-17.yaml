          "All over New York City, there is a woman in various states of
          undress, so baked into architecture that we barely even notice her.
          In the public library, she leans against a white horse; at the
          intersection of 59th and 5th, she perches atop a fountain; on 107th
          and Broadway, she reclines on a bed; and on top of the Manhattan
          Municipal Building she stands tall, this time cast in gold."

          "We built Scientist to fill in that missing piece and help test the
          production data and behavior to ensure correctness. It works by
          creating a lightweight abstraction called an experiment around the
          code that is to be replaced. The original code — the control — is
          delegated to by the experiment abstraction, and its result is
          returned by the experiment. The rewritten code is added as a
          candidate to be tried by the experiment at execution time. When the
          experiment is called at runtime, both code paths are run (with the
          order randomized to avoid ordering issues). The results of both the
          control and candidate are compared and, if there are any differences
          in that comparison, those are recorded. The duration of execution
          for both code blocks is also recorded. Then the result of the
          control code is returned from the experiment."
