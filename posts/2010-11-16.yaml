          "I anticipated a weird and slightly arduous journey, especially
          when it came to using the keyboard. To my great surprise, I picked
          it up immediately. Within 30 seconds, I checked the weather. Next,
          I read some stock prices. Amazingly, it even renders stock charts,
          something the blind have never had access to."

          "[...] people don't really talk much about code base size; it's not
          widely recognized as a problem. In fact it's widely recognized as
          a non-problem. [...] People in the industry are very excited about
          various ideas that nominally help you deal with large code bases,
          such as IDEs that can manipulate code as "algebraic structures", and
          search indexes, and so on. These people tend to view code bases much
          the way construction workers view dirt: they want great big machines
          that can move the dirt this way and that. [...] Industry programmers
          are excited about solutions to a big non-problem. It's just a
          mountain of dirt, and you just need big tools to move it around.
          The tools are exciting but the dirt is not."
