          gather data from log files on a bunch of different machines, demux
          that into a time-ordered event stream, pipe it through something to
          munge it into some slightly different format, ship that off via post
          to some web address and get some JSON back, parse that into some
          other shit, do some computation over it like aggregation or date math
          over time stamps with unlike representations, wrap the results up in
          an HTML table and send that table in a MIME-enabled e-mail to myself
          I think I am going to *explode.*"
