          "Strong coronavirus measures today should only last a few weeks,
          there shouldn’t be a big peak of infections afterwards, and it can
          all be done for a reasonable cost to society, saving millions of
          lives along the way. If we don’t take these measures, tens of
          millions will be infected, many will die, along with anybody else
          that requires intensive care, because the healthcare system will
          have collapsed."
