          I've been meaning to post these links in late 2021, when I was
          reading them, but I left them on a branch and completely forgot
          about it. Nevertheless, I recall these Swift Evolution
          proposals to be an excellent, intellectually stimulating, read.

          PS After 11.5 years, I've added an ability to add notes to posts
          on this link blog. Yay!
